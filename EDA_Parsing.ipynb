Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws and compliance with certain covenants under our loan facility with the United States Department of Energy, which restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 72 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graph This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference into any filing of Tesla Motors, Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Such returns are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance. Data for The NASDAQ Composite Index and the Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group assumes an investment of $100 on June 29, 2010 and reinvestment of dividends. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock nor do we anticipate paying any such cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On July 2, 2010, we sold 2,941,176 shares of our common stock to Toyota Motor Corporation at a price of $17.00 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $50.0 million. On November 2, 2010, we sold 1,418,573 shares of our common stock to an entity affiliated with Panasonic Corporation at a price of $21.148 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $30.0 million. The shares described above were issued in private transactions pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 73 Table of Contents Use of Proceeds Our IPO of common stock was effected through a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-164593) that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 28, 2010, which registered an aggregate of 15,295,000 shares of our common stock, including 1,995,000 shares that the underwriters had the option to purchase. On July 2, 2010, 11,880,600 shares of common stock were sold on our behalf and 3,414,400 shares of common stock were sold on behalf of the selling stockholders, including 1,995,000 shares sold by the selling stockholders upon exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, at an IPO price of $17.00 per share, for an aggregate gross offering price of $201,970,200 to us, and $58,044,800 to the selling stockholders. The underwriters of the offering were Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Following the sale of the shares in connection with the closing of the IPO, the offering terminated. We paid to the underwriters underwriting discounts and commissions totaling approximately $13.1 million in connection with the offering. In addition, we incurred additional costs of approximately $4.4 million in connection with the offering, which when added to the underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us, amounts to total fees and costs of approximately $17.5 million. Thus, the net offering proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs, were approximately $184.5 million. No offering costs were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates, other than reimbursement of legal expenses for selling stockholders. There was no material change in the use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b). From the effective date of the registration statement through December 31, 2010, we have used the net proceeds of the offering for working capital purposes, including expenditures for inventory, personnel costs, equipment and other operating expenses. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers None. 74 Table of Contents ITEM 6.'"
